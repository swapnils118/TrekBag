# Trekbag

A todo list which is helpful in keeping record of all items powered by local storage.

## Description

You can add an item to the list by either clicking Add to list button or with enter key.
A counter on top of the list displays packed items to the total number of items.
We can sort the list of items by the packed and unpacked property.
If anything goes out of hands, you can always reset the list to its initial state with Reset to initial button.
